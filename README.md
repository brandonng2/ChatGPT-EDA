# The Impact of ChatGPT on UCSD Students

**Author**: Brandon Ng and Sophia Yu

## Abstract

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized numerous industries and become integral to daily life, influencing tasks ranging from coding to problem-solving. AI's impact spans across healthcare, finance, retail, and notably, education. Our project aims to explore the interplay between academics and ChatGPT, an AI application, specifically investigating its effects on students at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) by analyzing changes in average grades and study hours. Utilizing data from UCSD CAPES, a website that encompasses course evaluations from 2007 to 2023, we categorized information by school affiliations, divisions, and departments to conduct a comprehensive analysis, accounting for potential confounding factors. Our findings reveal a general decrease in study hours alongside an improvement in average grades following the introduction of ChatGPT, suggesting a beneficial impact on academic performance. Moreover, subgroup analyses highlight differential impacts across student demographics. While acknowledging variables such as teaching styles and class structures, our study offers valuable insights into AI's educational applications, aiming to spur further research into its long-term effects on learning outcomes.

## Research Question
